#### Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a very advanced approach. 
- Often based on a common public key algorithm, ECC combines elliptic curves and number theory to encrypt data. 
- These elliptic curves are within finite fields and are symmetrical over the x-axis of a graph. Given these properties, cryptographers can provide robust security with much smaller and efficient keys. For example, an RSA key of 15,360 bits would be equivalent to an ECC key of just 512 bits.
- For Math lovers like Marina, Mamudu and Benson this one would be particularly appealing due to its use of number theory.
- This type of encryption is considered by Cisco Systems to be among the safest and most economical to use. It was explained in detail in a paper published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a section under the US Dept of Commerce.
- To quote Lyuba, above, “I'm not going to pretend I understand this method”. But if you are interested in diving into it, the full article can be found by clicking the link below.
